                In 2001, Adam Tihany visited the Sacco showroom on a hunt to
                design the Michelin Star restaurant, Perse. Collaborating with
                Tihany on Perse opened up a world of opportunity for Sacco
                including; The Breakers, Palm Beach, The Mandarin Oriental, Hong
                Kong and Restaurant Daniel, on Park Avenue. The hospitality
                greats soon followed with David Rockwell, Yabu Pushelberg,
                Jeffrey Beers and Toni Chi, who took Sacco to unforeseen
                heights. To meet the expectation and demand, Sacco hired the
                most talented artists in the industry and never sacrificed
                quality for price.

                effectiveness and longevity. Saccoâ€™s devoted sales team is
